                    After graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business IT, I started a Master's
                    degree in IT Management at the University of MÃ¼nster with a focus on Data Science.

                    In my free time however, I'm a passionate Music Producer & DJ but also interested in
                    all kinds of creative work.
                    For almost 10 years I have been working as a music producer and audio engineer on several
                    projects including <Link href="/portfolio" passHref><a>short films and YouTube
                    videos</a></Link>. But I've spent most of my time with creating music for my various 'artist
                    aliases' which you can discover in the <Link href="/music/novah" passHref><a>music
                    area</a></Link> of this website.
